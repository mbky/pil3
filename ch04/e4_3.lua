Many people argue that repeat-until is seldom used, and therefore it should not be present in a minimalistic language like Lua.  What do you think?

I think the most important aspects of Lua's minimalism is that has a small list of key concepts which are orthogoonal.  The addition (or omission) of repeat-until is ultimately a small detail.

In short, it's a small addition and doesn't introduce any new concepts, so I'll let it slide.

What I think is more interesting is that with a good (tm) macro system in Lua repeat-until could be added trivially and this question would be a non-issue.  That's a more interesting and probably more worthwhile debate.
